# Official Python STEEM Library

`steem-python` is the official Steem library for Python. It comes with a
BIP38 encrypted wallet and a practical CLI utility called `steempy`.

This library currently works on Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6. Python 3.3 and 3.4 support forthcoming.

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/steemit/steem-python.git
cd steem-python
python setup.py install

# CLI tools bundled

The library comes with a few console scripts.

* `steempy`:
